Conclusion

    TODO After implementation

Merlin-Segall is an intuitive algorithm; however, its paper is hard to swallow. Its pseudocode is far from software code and more like literal mathematical expression translation to code. Perhaps the finite state machine only exists to keep describing the algorithm with mathematical notations.

Its idea is similar to that of Chandy-Misra's as distance messages are sent among peers; however, unlike Chandy-Misra's holistic approach routes are completed in update rounds. In other words, it reaches the minimum cost/latency path one step at a time.

    In general a short summarizing paragraph will do, and under no circumstances should the paragraph simply repeat material from the Abstract or Introduction. In some cases it's possible to now make the original claims more concrete, e.g., by referring to quantitative performance results [Widom2006].

    The conclusion is where you build upon your discussion and try to refer your findings to other research and to the world at large. In a short research paper, it may be a paragraph or two, or practically non-existent. In a dissertation, it may well be the most important part of the entire paper - not only does it describe the results and discussion in detail, it emphasizes the importance of the results in the field, and ties it in with the previous research. Some research papers require a recommendations section, postulating that further directions of the research, as well as highlighting how any flaws affected the results. In this case, you should suggest any improvements that could be made to the research design [Shuttleworth2016].
